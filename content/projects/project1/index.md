description: "This dataset contains all irregular verbs in known Romance languages."
summary: "During **Google Summer of Code** 2024, I contributed to an open-source implementation of **GenCast**, a generative model for weather prediction.
GenCast integrates diffusion models, graph neural networks, and transformers to produce accurate, high-resolution forecasts.
This work was made possible through the mentorship and support of **Open Climate Fix**."
